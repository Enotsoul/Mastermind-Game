## Security considerations
This project contains some things that I wouldn't recommend you simulate or use in the real world unless you play with your friends.
Please note that security wise it has some issues which I've tested and exploited  but didn't fix since I'd rather leave it as a homework for cyber security enthousiasts.
This repo will NEVER be updated again so I know that the passwords are stored in palintext and I didn't even bother to use MD5 or SHA1 since security wasn;t a priority while developing it.
Secure development can take longer than normal development.
